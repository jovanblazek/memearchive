## Why is everything hardcoded?
The goal was to host it for free, without requiring a domain name. At the time, Github pages were perfect for this. This has meant that I could not have used a database for storing all data. 

However, content is not hardcoded per se. I wrote a script in C which generated all `img` tags for me.
